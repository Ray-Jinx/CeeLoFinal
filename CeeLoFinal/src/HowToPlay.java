Everyone who rolls gets three attempts to make a viable set, but once a set is made, they can no longer roll. Typical play is looking for a pair in two of your three dice. When you get a pair, the third die is your \"points\", so if you roll a 2, 2, and 3, your points are 3. Getting a 1 is an automatic loss, and a 6 is an automatic win. If after three rolls you cannot make a viable set, then you get \"No point\" and it's an automatic loss. If the banker ever gets an automatic win or loss, the round ends there and play moves to the next banker.");
